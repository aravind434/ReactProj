what is Creator and why should we use?

==> When we working on a porject, each developer might give a different name for action , so in that case action type will mismatch. To over come this kind of issues introduced creators to create common action means its like dynamic names, not constant.

==>Action type is used to add/create global/environment action variables with export, so we can use dynamic variable, even someone change value it will not impact bcz of using the variable name as dynamic to get dynamic data/action type.

So in this branch im going to add action creators and action type creators on older branch.
